# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I am an <b>open source programmer</b>. I am passionate about building amazing projects that make user life easier, empower developers and <b>competetive programming</b>.

# Skills
Though, I try to work with most popular programming languages as I beleive in choosing the right language for the right task thus writing a maintainable code and optimizing the workflow. Though, here are list of some languages that I know. But, I try to apply the concepts and my problem solving skills to solve the issue in a given stack.</br>
<b>HTML | CSS | JavaScript | React JS | Next JS | SQL | MongoDB | C# | C/C++ | Kotlin | Flutter | Java |</b>

# Contributing
I mostly focus on creating small tools that make my everyday coding easier. If an amazing tools that might be helpful to anyone those repositories are made public. 
- Public repositories only store non-copyright, <i>free to use/resue code</i> and <b>non-commercial</b> use with no author credit is permitted. (The policy/liscence that is associated with the repository might be different but the purpose remains the same.)
- Private repositories are not available but could sometimes require a few eyes to maintain and develop. That is due to propietery codebase or part of one. Access to such repositories is often limited and generally friends at work.
- If you want to solve a bug then just create a pull otherwise please, Fork it. Fork first is the rule, this is due to mostly due to low maintaince after a project has been released to public. As most of the code is more like a module.
- For creating a pull please be clear about the issue it fixes, I will review it as soon as possible and merge it.
Thank you being a part of the journey.
